Document database model is a non-relational database model that stores and retrieves data in self-describing document formats like JSON, XML, or BSON, and allows nesting or linking of documents. In contrast, Hierarchical Data Model organizes data in a tree-like structure where each parent node has multiple child nodes, but a child node can only have one parent node. Network Data Model is similar to Hierarchical model, but it allows each child node to have multiple parent nodes. Relational Data Model stores data in tables with predefined relationships between them, where each table represents an entity, and each row represents a unique instance of that entity. Unlike the document model, these models require pre-defined schemas and have limited flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data.

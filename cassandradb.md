The official webpage of CassandraDB is https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html. CassandraDB is an open source noSQL type of database. CassandraDB does not fall into the three categories of databases and is a noSQL distributed database. Cassandra DB uses a distributed, peer-to-peer architecture where data is partitioned and replicated across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. Java can access Cassandra DB using the Java Driver API provided by the DataStax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra.
